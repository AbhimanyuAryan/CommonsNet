## Sharing and Transparency for WiFi Networks

Across the world there are different legal settings and requirements for sharing of Internet connections and specifically Open Wifi connections. 

CommonsNet website reflects these details. We provide with a great tool to collect all wifi details and enable people to share them with others. Our simple and easy-to-follow form let gather WiFi information in a orderly and transparent manner, and then immediately generate a human readable file to download or machine readable file of the level of sharing that is offered by someone to copy and paste on website and make transparent details public.
