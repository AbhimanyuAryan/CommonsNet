                <h4>What is CommonsNet?</h4>
                    <p>  <b> CommonsNet is an open source app developed as FOSSASIA project during Google Summer of Code 2016.  </b> 
                    </p>
                    <p>We focuses on making wireless connection more transparent to its users and supporting its sharing. We want people to be provided with clear data about wireless connection they want to use in four separated section.
                      </p>
                     <p> <b> Settings  </b> - We want people to know what are the basic settings of wireless connection. SSID, password, authentication and standard are all important features for us to get to know while starting using a specific WiFi. Based on that we can say how safe are we, and what is the possibilies of capacity’s trouble or even kind of devices we can use.  </p>
                        <p> <b>  Payment </b> - next, we believe people should get clear information if the wifi they want to use is paid or not, or if they are obliged to keep time limit. </p>
                         <p> <b> Conditions </b> - we want to also make people aware of conditions to use wireless connection and let them know what do they need to do in order to connect to offered wifi. </p>
                          <p> <b> Legal restrictions </b>  - Finally, we have no doubt that last but not least part of imporant information about wifi are legal restrictions. We don’t want them to be a real boundary or make some trouble for someone due to the lack of knowledge. We want people to be aware of things they are not allowed to do while connecting to Internet in a specific place and be safer as well. </p>
